# GAME
I did this project (the tic-tac-toe game) following this tutorial: "Curso de React desde cero: Crea un videojuego y una aplicaci√≥n para aprender useState y useEffect" by midudev, a web developer who creates content for people who are learning. This is the link: https://youtu.be/qkzcjwnueLA?si=7NpIjVB-TWfO02ed.


## Tech Stack

This is a front-end project in which I used **React** on the client side.


## Installation

To create this project, I run the command "npm create vite@latest" in the terminal (using git bash). I selected React and JavaScript + SWC.

Then, in the directory folder (cd Game), I ran "npm install" to install the dependencies I needed. 

Next, you have to run the command "npm run dev" to initialize the project in the browser. (You have to do ctrl+click on the port shown in the terminal to follow the link to run it locally).


## Demo

This is the video of the project:
